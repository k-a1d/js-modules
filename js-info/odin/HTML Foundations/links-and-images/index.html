            The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
            The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it.
            The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.

        <!--
            In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. 
            Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. 
            By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.

            It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

<!--
"use strict" is used to ensure javascript code works the "modern way". The JS interpreter is able to make more optimisations on 
strict mode compared to non-strict code. This can improve the efficiency of JS functions.

The "use strict" only applies to everything below it
-->

<script>
    alert("some code"); // Strict mode IS NOT activated for this line

    "use strict"; // Active for all lines below

    alert("some code"); // Strict mode IS activated for this line
</script>
